## 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and modeling weather data to extract meaningful insights and predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. It includes data exploration, visualization, feature engineering, and a simple linear regression model.

### 📁 Files

- `weather.csv`: Dataset containing weather information such as temperature, rainfall, and dates.
- `weather_data_analysis.py`: Python script performing exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and a predictive model for rainfall.

---

### 🔍 Project Overview

#### Objectives:
- Understand weather patterns using data visualization.
- Analyze seasonal trends such as temperature variations by month.
- Predict rainfall using linear regression based on temperature features.

---

### 📊 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Read and explore the weather dataset using `pandas`.
2. **Data Exploration**: Examine data structure and summary statistics.
3. **Visualization**: Create pair plots and monthly average temperature trends.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Extract month from the date for trend analysis.
5. **Rainfall Prediction**: Use linear regression to predict rainfall based on min and max temperatures.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Compute the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model performance.
7. **Insights**: Identify months with the highest and lowest average temperatures.

### 📈 Output Examples

- Pairplot of `MinTemp`, `MaxTemp`, and `Rainfall`
- Line plot showing average max temperature by month
- Printed MSE of rainfall prediction
- Identified months with highest/lowest rainfall
